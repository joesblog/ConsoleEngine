# ConsoleEngineCSharp
Based on OLC Console Engine, this is for c#(.net)


# What is this?
This a C# port of @Javidx9's Console Game Engine

# Why?
C# is a language that you can create things with quickly without having to worry (too much) with things like memory management and pointers,
having said that if you look at the code you can see we do use pointers and things..

# How do i use it?
Just reference the CGE Project in this file into your project, create a class that inherits CEng and treat it like the C++ version.

# Can i...?
Yes you can do what you like with it, please credit me and @Javidx9 if you wish...
